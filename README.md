- 👋 Hi, I’m Sébastien !
- 👀 I’m interested in everything webdev, with a passion for graphic libs such as three.js and d3.js
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react.js (coming from Vue) & typescript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything small ! Project can be huge, that's fine by me, but I like my contributions small and maintainable. Yeah... I got kids === I ain't got muuuch time :P
- 📫 How to reach me on twitter, might be best. @Console_buche
